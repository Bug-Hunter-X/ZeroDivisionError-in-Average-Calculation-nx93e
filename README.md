# Python: Handling ZeroDivisionError in Average Calculation

This repository demonstrates a common error in Python and its robust solution. The `bug.py` file contains code that calculates the average of a list of numbers, but fails to handle the case where the input list is empty. This leads to a `ZeroDivisionError`. The `bugSolution.py` provides a corrected version that addresses this issue.
